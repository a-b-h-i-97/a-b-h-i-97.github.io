                        I had been an executive of CSEA since 2016 and had been actively involved in all of its 
                        activities. As secretary, I led the organization and oversaw all its regular activities 
                        for the academic year. During my tenure, we started Interview Diaries - an internal 
                        repository of interview experiences exclusively for the students of NITC. I conceptualized 
                        and oversaw the transition of our department newsletter, <a href="https://threads.nitc.ac.in/" target="_blank">Threads</a> 
                        onto a new platform with emphasis on usability and maintainability. Apart from 
                        regular talks and workshops, we organized an internal hackathon for NITC students. I was 
                        also involved with <a href="https://fossmeet.in/" target="_blank">FOSSMeet</a> and led the 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK0pl4y5cWDlGEEGEfHb5rBO84Qjuf3jR" target="_blank">talks</a>

                        CSEA showed me the power of teamwork - what a focused group of individuals with a goal 
                        can achieve. I realized that it takes people of quality to take initiatives that transform 
                        <i>good</i> to the <i>best</i>. It improved my leadership qualities, made me a better listener
                        and taught me to respect others peoples' choices and opinion. It taught me that honest and critical feedback
                        is one of the strongest tools to keep improving as an individual and as a unit.

                        I worked with the Calendar team of Microsoft Teams. I developed reusable UI components using 
                        React and Typescript to support the recurrence feature in the new events workflow. Apart from 
                        learning React and Typescript, I got hands on experience with UI libraries like Semantic UI, testing 
                        frameworks like Jest and UI tools like Storybooks. I also realized the importance of things 
                        like accessibility and localization which come into play when developing software at a global scale.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Microsoft was my first corporate job, developing software for a global user base using a highly 
                        structured software engineering workflow collaborating with developers around the globe. I got 
                        to work with an amazing bunch of people who were always ready to help each other. Most importantly 
                        it taught me that taking ownership is beyond taking responsibility. The offer 
                        for a permanent role at Microsoft at the end of the internship was the icing on the cake.

                        The summer internship at Fourth Frontier was my first <i>real</i> developer job. I worked on developing
                        algorithms for processing biological signals like ECG in a highly memory efficient manner. These algorithms
                        were implemented in C to run natively on a device that was being built. I did some minor work on their Android
                        application as well which involved updating certain algorithms running within the app as they evolved.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It was an amazing experience to work with a small group of people who were incredibly passionate about the work that they
                        did. The best part of the experience was to see the product evolve in all aspects. There were electronics engineers
                        working on the hardware, designers who were working on its aesthetics and comfort, developers working on algorithms,
                         mobile applications, web frameworks and people who were working on marketing and other business aspects. All of
                        this happened in a space where all of us could see each other.

                        The four years at NITC was a truly transformative educational experience. Courses offered by awesome 
                        professors there gave me sound fundamental knowledge about the discipline and helped me 
                        develop the passion to keep learning everyday. Moreover they taught me to put knowledge before grades and 
                        integrity over everything else. I met so many people, each talented in their own ways. I made 
                        friendships and memories for a lifetime and learned to respect them. The diversity there taught 
                        me to acknowledge my privileges. Overall, it made me a better person and taught me to be professional 
                        in every aspect.
